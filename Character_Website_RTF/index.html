        <h3>Unit History</h3> 
        <p>In 2009, Officer Cal Moreaux, a Detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, investigated a series of cases involving replicants. His search began with a break-in by one such replicant, followed by a suspicious suicide case within the Tyrell Corporation.</p>
        <p>As Officer Moreaux uncovered the mysteries, he found himself in a search surrounding the Nexus-5 replicants. Joining forces with a replicant, Detective Moreaux embarked on a mission to uncover the truth.</p>
        <p>Their efforts led to the rescue of an individual named Marcus and unveiled the unsettling reality behind the Nexus-5 replicants. During their pursuit of a rogue Tyrell Corporation representative, a tragic incident occurred involving a person known to Moreaux.</p>
